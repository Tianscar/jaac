# Java AAC Decoder
This is a fork of [DV8FromTheWorld/JAADec](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JAADec/), containing bug fixes mainly from [these forks](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JAADec/forks).

This library is an AAC decoder and MP4 demultiplexer library written completely in Java. It uses no native libraries, is platform-independent and portable. It can read MP4 container from almost every input-stream (files, network sockets etc.) and decode AAC-LC (Low Complexity) and HE-AAC (High Efficiency/AAC+).
